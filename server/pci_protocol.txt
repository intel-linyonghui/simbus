* The PCI Clock

This is entirely under the control of the server.

* IDSEL mapping

On a PCI bus, the device number is used to select the IDSEL signal
that is routed to it. The bus supports 16 directly-connected devices
(including hosts) and the device number may be a value from 0-15
inclusive. The IDSEL signal is generated from the AD bus, with IDSEL
for device-0 connected to AD[16], IDSEL for device-1 to AD[17], and so
on up to device-15 to AD[31]. Hosts and devices are treated equally by
the server. The IDSEL mapping is done by the server, so any bus master
(device or host) can generate configuration cycles with the desired
IDSEL bits set.

* INTx# mapping

Devices (not hosts) have 4 interrupt outputs, INTA#, INTB#, INTC# and
INTD#. These are used as expected.

Hosts, on the other hand, only have interrupt *inputs*. The host sees
the signals INTA#, INTB#, INTC# and INTD# for as 16bit vectors, with
each bit position of the vector representing the interrupt for the
corresponding device. Thus the host sees and can differentiate all the
interrupts from all the devices. If the host simulation wants to
simulate shared interrupts, it does so internally.

* Arbitration

The server contains the arbitor, so the host is treated like any other
device with its own REQ# and GNT# signals.

* Address/Data

The PCI protocol supports 64bit busses. The AD vector is 64bits and
the C/BE# vector is 8 bits always.  If a device is only being a 32bit
device, then it will send Z bits in the high 32 of the AD vector and
the high 4 bits of C/BE#. This keeps the protocol handling uniform.
